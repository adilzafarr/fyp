## ðŸ”¸ General Suggestions

1. **Navigation**: Use `React Navigation` (Stack Navigator for auth flow, Tab/Drawer for main app)
2. **State Management**: `Redux`, `Zustand`, or simple Context API (especially for user and mood state)
3. **Theme**: Consider using `tailwind-rn` or `styled-components` to maintain design consistency
4. **Fonts**: Use custom fonts that match the Urdu script styling you're using
5. **Mood Tracking UI**: A mood graph (line chart / bar chart) would be amazing in the Mood Tracker screen
